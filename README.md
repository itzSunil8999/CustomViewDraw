Creating Custom View

Here I created the Custom View which outputs a face emoji as shown below ðŸ‘‡

As you can see, there are two small face emojis on top left and right corners with having happy face and sad face respectively.
When you click on happy emoji the bigger Face becomes Happy and when you click on sad emoji it becomes sad.

When you click on happy emoji ðŸ‘‡

When you click on sad emoji ðŸ‘‡

So this is the project where I tried to use Custom View and Draw together for my practice as a beginner.
